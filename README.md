# trusted-commit-signatures

Validate Integrity and Provenance of Git Commits by Trust Pinning Commit Signatures to Public Keys maintained within the Repository.

## Intro

Let's briefly review some basics and thoughts on commit signing...

### The idea

In general, code should be signed to ensure integrity and provenance and thus protect against tampering or unauthorized code injection.
One solution is to sign git commits and verify those within the repository.
To do so, one can for example use GitHub [Commit Signature Verification](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification/about-commit-signature-verification).
In essence, a GPG key pair is created and the public key added to the GitHub account and local git configuration:

```bash
# generate the key (configuration)
gpg --full-generate-key
> follow the configuration prompt

# list new key
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long
> gpg: checking the trustdb
> gpg: marginals needed: 3  completes needed: 1  trust model: pgp
> gpg: depth: 0  valid:   1  signed:   0  trust: 0-, 0q, 0n, 0m, 0f, 1u
> /root/.gnupg/pubring.kbx
> ------------------------
> sec   rsa4096/0C579BD96E991F8F 2021-07-10 [SC]
>       E2A688D9A90F0ACE8C30F4BD0C579BD96E991F8F
> uid                 [ultimate] Signer One <signer.one@xhostservice.xyz>
> ssb   rsa4096/A733CB119010B966 2021-07-10 [E]

# export key (select your own key ID) - add this key to you GitHub account
gpg --armor --export 0C579BD96E991F8F > .pubkeys/signer1.gpg.pub
> -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----
> mQINBGDqLaMBEADJyBjsdyebTvzFHs6N2noqOFjvD8P9ANaFNPQseEmHHlGqRqgk
> (...)
> flEpbxq/Fo4D1nIOTM9qqMd9D3PHuYY2anU1mFMHV1aqHMMItan56rStMfqCa+sj
> 8X59tQ==
> =vplr
> -----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----

git config --global user.signingkey 0C579BD96E991F8F
```

Now, you can sign your commits using:

```bash
git commit -S -m "signer1: signed commit"
```

GitHub allows you to enforce valid signatures on protected branches and ... tada!? :tada: ... the world has become a safer place.

### The problem

But did it really?
As argued by [Dan Lorenc](https://twitter.com/lorenc_dan) in [this blog post](https://dlorenc.medium.com/should-you-sign-git-commits-f068b07e1b1f), the keys -- that are meant to serve as a new root of trust -- are only authorized by adding them to the GitHub account and thus relying on your GitHub account security.
As a result, if an attacker manages to gain access to your account, that same attacker can also simply add a new key and will forth on be happily signing malicious commits in your name that show up as `verified` by GitHub.
As also outlined in the blog post, a common solution is to have some form of out-of-band verification of the key like a PKI, but that seems to be barely ever the case and as a result the `verified` tag on your commit seems to add little value beyond a false sense of security.

### The solution

However, this statement that an external source of trust is required to make commit signatures useful got me intrigued to create this little project:

> "Unless you store and distribute your public keys using some other system (in a separate trust domain from GitHub), you donâ€™t really gain any protections from having your account compromised here."

Inspired by DNSSEC as opposed to delegating trust to an external party, it is possible to pin the trust to public keys that are directly maintained within the GitHub repository itself.
By adding your public key to the repository say the `.pubkeys` folder with the initial commit, all subsequent commits can be verified against that public key.
A *trusted contributor* is then a contributor with a private key to a public key within the `.pubkeys` folder.

If we go one step further and verify each commit signature against the public keys within the previous commit, we can also add and revoke public keys for new or former contributors by having a trusted contributor add or remove the corresponding public key to/from the `.pubkeys` folder:

```bash
 Step 1  Step 2  Step 3  S...
 verify  verify  verify  v...
 |     \ |     \ |     \ |
C0 ---> C1 ---> C2 ---> C3...
```

Using trusted commits can protect against contributor account compromise or a malicious code plattform provider.

## Howto

To test trusted commits, you can clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/xopham/trusted-commit-signatures.git
cd trusted-commit-signatures
```

There is 3 ways to run `verify_commits.sh`:

- directly run it on your machine: `./verify_commits.sh`
> :warning: Please be a bit careful as the code is not extensively tested :wink:
- Build and run it as a docker container: `./docker/build_and_run.sh`
- Run the pre-built container: `docker run -v $(git rev-parse --show-toplevel):/tmp docker.io/xoph/commit-verifier`

The output should looks similar to:

```bash

### RESULTS ###
Trust all the commits!?
```

The script fails in case you now make a change and create a commit without signature or with your own key and then run `verify_commits.sh` again.

This repository also contains a GitHub action that checks all PRs for trusted commits.
While this can for example also check all incoming PRs or validate the repository frequently, there seems no way to protect an action from just being removed by the next commit.
Consequently, the commit verification currently has to happen locally.

## Examples

A few simple examples for usage of trusted commit signatures are provided.

### Untrusted commits

As an example for untrusted commits, checkout the `untrusted-commits` branch:

```bash
git checkout untrusted-commits
```

If you run `verify_commits.sh` over the untrusted commits, you will get:

```bash
INFO: Temporary gnupg home '.gpg' created.

### Adding and removing another public key

To see how a public key can be added and removed, checkout the `add-remove-pubkeys` branch:

```bash
git checkout add-remove-pubkeys
```

If you run `verify_commits.sh` over this branch, you will get:

```bash
